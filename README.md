Brief
----
This was our first attempt at TDD using RSpec. We were given the task of writing a program that could play the game 'FizzBuzz'.
```sh
The rules
* If a number is divisible by 3, it should be replaced by the word 'Fizz'
* If a number is divisible by 5, it should be replaced by the word 'Buzz'
* If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it should be replaced by the word 'FizzBuzz'
```
In order to complete this task we were given strict instructions to thoroughly test drive our development (Red, Green, Refactor), and to adhere to SRT and DRY principles. We did not make use of any classes due to the relative simplicity of the program. 

Tech
----
* Ruby
* RSpec

Outcome
----
We repeated this kata several times until we had it down to around 7 minutes. At that time I was also learning VIM, so I made a little video to demonstrate the techniques. Here is the link:
